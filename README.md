- There are three types of dankfarmer files in this repository i.e. dankfarmer1.py, dankfarmer2.py, dankfarmer3.py
- Each file is different but the main purpose of the code is same in each file, also they run differently from each other so you can choose the way you want to run the code.

## DankFarmer1

- you can host and use it locally.

### ___Installation methods___
- Make sure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/) is installed on your system.
